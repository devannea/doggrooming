                      It is recommended to begin having your puppy groomed <strong>as soon as possible</strong>. Early exposure to grooming will help your puppy to be confident during appointments and can reduce the probability of stress or fear. It is important to inform your groomer that it is your puppy's first time being groomed. A slow introduction to loud devices like clippers or the nail dremel is imperative for your puppy to have a successful session.

                      The time between appointments is determined by the type of style you want to achieve and are interested in maintaining. A style that is very fluffy and very high maintenance would require more frequent visits (generally every 4 weeks) than a style that is very short and lower maintenance (every 8 weeks). To maintain a long coat style, I recommend brushing once a day, or a very thorough brush out once a week. You can book a brush out session between grooming appointments if the task is too time consuming.

                        Brushing dogs with long or curly coats does not come naturally, but with the right tools and technique, this time-consuming task can become a wonderful bonding opportunity for you and your pet.<br>
                        <strong>Tools Needed:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Long Pin Slicker Brush - ideal for removing any debris built up in the coat and for removing tangles</li>
                            <li>A Metal Comb - sometimes called a poodle comb or a greyhound comb, depends on the length of the teeth</li>
                            <li>Leave-In Conditioner or Detangling Spray - helps to make the hair slick and easier to brush through if tangled</li>
                        </ul>
                        When brushing your dog, you will want to use a technique called line brushing - this method allows you to work in sections around your dog's face and body, and to brush beyond the surface of the coat down to the skin. There are several YouTube videos on the subject, but I'll link <a id="video-link" href="https://youtu.be/vY-Vzc-1nU0?si=26Y3Mw6UXz-zkdLR">a tutorial on how to line brush here</a>.<br>
                        If you cannot glide your comb through your dog's coat, I cannot get my clipper guard through it. This means a longer style would be difficult to achieve.

                        Though it is sometimes possible to save coats that are tangled, a matted coat is very different. Until actually seeing and feeling a dog's coat, I cannot judge the severity of the matting. I will not shave a matted dog without informing the pet parent that I recommend a fresh start and getting permission to do so. To shave a matted dog, there is a $15 fee added to the cost of the service. If the coat can be saved, the <strong>de-matting fee</strong> is $1/minute of brush out time; so if I spend 60 minutes de-matting a dog, it is $60 added to the cost of the service.

                        <strong>What Are Fleas?</strong><br>
                        A flea is a tiny insect and is the most common parasite found on our pets. They can jump up to 200 times their body length.<br>
                        <strong>How Do Fleas Spread?</strong><br>
                        Flea eggs and larvae fall from a host's body onto the ground, then latch onto their next host. Adult fleas jump from host to host to lay eggs. Fleas can lay 40 - 60 eggs per day.<br>
                        <strong>What Diseases Do Fleas Transmit/ Cause?</strong><br>
                        <ul class="diseases">
                            <li class="disease-item">Tapeworms</li>
                            <li class="disease-item">Bartonella</li>
                            <li class="disease-item">Anemia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>Can Indoor Pets Get Fleas?</strong><br>
                        Yes, though uncommon, flea eggs and larvae can latch onto clothing items like shoes or other pets and spread that way.<br>
                        <strong>Did You Know:</strong><br>
                        The fleas you can see on your pet only make up for 5% of the total population infesting your pet's living space. Flea eggs can be found in crevices between wooden planks, in grout lines for tile, or in carpet. Do not only treat your pet for fleas, but your home and or yard, too!<br>
                        <strong>How To Prevent Fleas:</strong><br>
                        There are topical and chewable flea preventatives for dogs and cats. Most protect against fleas for one month or longer. Speak to your vet about the different options availble for your pet. If you are interested in booking for a flea & tick treatment, be sure to treat the area your pet spends most of their time in too!

                        <strong>Long Nails Can Cause:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain</li>
                            <li>Splayed or deformed feet</li>
                            <li>Reduced traction</li>
                            <li>Injured tendons</li>
                            <li>Arthritis</li>
                        </ul>
                        You can prevent this with regular nail clipping, every 2 - 3 weeks until the quick (vein) recedes into the nail.<br>
                        When clipping nails, clip the nail just beyond the curve of the nail. Use styptic powder to stop the bleeding if you clip too far.<br>
                        If you do not have styptic powder, you can use flour or cornstarch as a subsitute.<br>
                        <strong>With very long nails:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The quick (vein) may grow into the nail, eventually making it almost impossible to cut the nail without cutting the quick as well</li>
                            <li>The nail may grow into the paw pad</li>
                        </ul>
                        <strong>Benefits of having your pet's nails filed:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eliminates the jagged/ sharp edges of the nails</li>
                            <li>Lasts longer than only clipping the nails</li>
                            <li>Easier to avoid the quick (vein)</li>
                        </ul>
