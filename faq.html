                      <b id="video-link">Start early!</b> I recommend scheduling your puppy's first grooming appointment <b>as soon as they've had their first round of vaccinations</b> (usually around 8—10 weeks old).<br>
                      Getting your puppy used to the sights, sounds, and sensations of grooming early on helps them build confidence and comfort with the process. The first groom is all about <b>calm, gentle introduction</b> - focused on positive handling, desensitization to grooming tools, and creating a foundation for a lifetime of stress-free grooming. Progress is prioritized over perfection.

                      <b>There is not a one-size-fits-all answer to grooming frequency.</b> The right schedule depends on your dog's age, health, temperament, and coat type. My goal is always the same: comfort, safety, and a positive experience—not just how a dog looks when they leave.<br>
                      <b id="video-link">Adult Dogs & Coat Length</b> For most adult dogs, grooming frequency depends largely on coat type and desired length.
                      <ul>
                        <li><b>Short Coats:</b> Can typically go longer between appointments</li>
                        <li><b>Long or Curly Coats:</b> Require more frequent grooming to prevent matting and discomfort.</li>
                      </ul>
                      Longer coats always mean more maintenance—both at home and professionally.<br>
                      <b id="video-link">Puppies</b> Puppies benefit from <b>more frequent visits</b>, especially early on. These don't have to be full grooms. Short, positive appointments like nail trims, baths, face or paw tidy-ups, or just coming in to meet the groomer help puppies learn that grooming is a normal, safe part of life.<br>
                      <ul>Frequent low-pressure visits:
                        <li>Build confidence and trust</li>
                        <li>Reduce fear later in life</li>
                        <li>Make future grooming easier and less stressful</li>
                      </ul>
                      Think of puppy grooming as training, not maintenance.<br>
                      <b id="video-link">Senior Dogs & Dogs with Medical Considerations</b> Senior dogs and dogs with health concerns often do best with less frequent, lower-maintenance grooming. Comfort is the priority.
                      <ul>I typically recommend:
                        <li>Shorter, easier-to-maintain haircuts</li>
                        <li>Shorter appointments</li>
                        <li>Gentle handling with plenty of breaks</li>
                      </ul>
                      This approach minimizes physical strain and stress while still keeping your dog clean, comfortable, and cared for.<br>
                      <b id="video-link">Anxious or Sensitive Dogs</b> Dogs who are nervous or anxious often benefit from more frequent visits, but with varying levels of intensity.
                      <ul>
                        This may include:
                        <li>Simple walk-in nail trims</li>
                        <li>Bath-only appointments</li>
                        <li>Partial grooms before working up to full services</li>
                      </ul>
                      Consistency builds familiarity, and familiarity builds trust. I never believe in forcing a dog through grooming. A respectful, patient approach allows anxious dogs to progress at their own pace.

                        <ul>
                            <li>A <b>soft pin slicker brush</b></li>
                            <li>A <b>metal comb</b></li>
                            <li>A <b>detangling spray</b> - never brush a dry coat! It can cause breakage and discomfort.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b id="video-link">Technique: Line Brushing</b>
                        Use the <b>line brushing</b> method: part the coat in sections and brush small layers from the skin outward, using a pat and pull motion. Mats form at the base of the hair, close to the skin, and brushing only the top coat won't remove them. There are several YouTube videos on the subject, but I'll link <a id="video-link" href="https://youtu.be/vY-Vzc-1nU0?si=26Y3Mw6UXz-zkdLR">a tutorial on how to line brush here</a>.<br>
                        <b id="video-link">The Comb Test</b> After brushing a section, run your comb through it. If it glides smoothly from root to tip with <b>no snags</b>, you're doing great! If the comb gets caught, mats are still present - and if I can't get a comb through, <b>my clipper guards can't either</b>, which means the coat may need to be cut shorter for your dog's comfort.

If your dog if <b>pelted</b> (severely matted close to the skin), the safest and most humane option is a <b>shave-down</b>. Mats pull tightly on the skin and can cause pain, bruising, or sores - so when clipping them out, I work very slowly and carefully to avoid injury. This adds significant time to the groom.<br>
                        <b id="video-link">If de-matting is possible</b>, it still requires extra time, patience, and care - especially for dogs with sensitive skin or anxiety.<br>
                        Because of the added time involved, I charge a <b id="video-link">$2/minute matting fee</b>. This is not a de-matting fee—it's a <b>time-based fee</b> that applies whether I shave a pelted coat or gently work through tangles. If you do not agree to this fee, or do not consent to a shave-down when necessary, I will respectfully decline to groom your dog for their safety and well-being.<br>
                        My goal is to keep pets <b>safe, comfortable, and stress-free</b>—even if that means starting over with a shorter haircut.

                        If your dog has <b>fleas</b>, I can remove the ones currently on their body during the grooming session—but grooming alone <b id="video-link">will not prevent reinfestation</b>. Fleas lay hundreds of eggs that fall into you <b>home, bedding, and yard</b>, which can lead to a new outbreak within days or weeks.<br>
                        <b id="video-link">Treating your home is just as important</b> as treating your dog. I recommend a thorough cleaning, vacuuming, washing bedding, and using safe home treatments.<br>
                        <b>For long-term protection</b>, speak to your vet about a <b id="video-link">prescription-strength flea and tick preventative</b>. Over-the-counter products are often not strong enough to stop the flea life cycle.<br>
                        <b id="video-link">If your dog is heavily infested</b>, I may refer you to a veterinarian before grooming. Severe infestations can lead to serious health concerns like <b>tapeworms, anemia, and flea-borne illnesses</b> (such as Bartonella). In these cases, your dog's health comes first—and vet care is the safest next step.

                        <b id="video-link">Long nails can cause real pain and long-term damage</b>. When a dog's nails get too long, they start to push back into the nail bed with every step. Over time, this can lead to:
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>Painful, splayed feet</b></li>
                          <li><b>Reduced traction</b>, making slips and injuries more likely</li>
                          <li><b>Strained tendons</b> as your dog's posture shifts to compensate</li>
                          <li><b>Arthritis and joint issues</b> from long-term pressure and misalignment</li>
                          <li>And in severe cases, <b>nails growing into the paw pad</b>, which can cause infections or require vet intervention</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Some of these effects are not reversible</b>, so prevention is key.<br>
                        <b>Regular nail trims can help!</b> With consistent care, we can gradually encourage the <b>quick (the vein inside the nail) to recede</b>, allowing for shorter, healthier nails over time. This keeps your pup more comfortable, mobile, and happy.<br>
                        Even if your dogs is nervous about nails, I work gently and patiently - and regular appointments help build trust and confidence.<br>
